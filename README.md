### About Codenames

Codenames is a 2015 card game for 4–8 players designed by Vlaada Chvátil and published by Czech Games. Two teams compete by each having a Spymaster give one word clues which can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team. In the 2–3 player variant, one Spymaster gives clues to the other player or players.

In 2016 Codenames won the Spiel des Jahres award for the best board game of the year.
